# Euchre - C++

Objective: Euchre is a popular card game that is played with a deck of 24 cards, and is usually played by four players in teams of two. The objective of the game is to win tricks, which are won by playing the highest card of the suit led, or by playing a trump card, which is a card of a special suit that can beat any other suit.

Implementation: This GitHub project is an implementation of Euchre using C++, which allows users to play the game against computer opponents or against other players over a network. The project uses object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, such as classes and inheritance, to represent the game entities, such as cards, decks, players, and tricks.

Platform: The Euchre implementation is designed to run on multiple platforms, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS. The project includes makefiles and build scripts that allow users to compile and run the game on their local machines.
